üê∂ Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify Different Dog Breeds


In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.


## 1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog


## 2. Data

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview


## 3. Evaluation


The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.


## 4. Features

Some information about the data:
* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's a probably best we use deep learning
* There are 120 breeds of dogs
* There are around 10,000+  images in the training set.
* There are around 10,000+  images in the test set.
